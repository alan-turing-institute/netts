I see a man in the dark standing against a light post. It seems to be in the middle of the night; I think because the lightbulb is working. On the picture there seems to be like a park and... Or trees but in those trees there are little balls of light reflections as well. I cannot see the… Anything else because it’s very dark. But the man on the picture seems to wear a hat and, and has a jacket on and he seems to have a hoodie on as well. The picture is very, very mysterious, which I like about it, but for me I would like to understand more concept, context of the picture.
