This image is pretty boring. Kind of represents, um, olden times when wife and the child … When the wife and the child would just stay at home whilst the father is the bread earner. Um, it’s quite a sad photo but also in lighting because of the way that women have grown since this time and it has been able to portray development of women through time, which is obviously very good.
