Well, on the picture I see four men lying on the field, they seem to be some sort of workers and they seem to be tired and presumably, maybe it’s during midday, because their hats are covering their heads. One of the men seems to be standing up, who doesn’t have a hat on and he’s leaning towards the other three men that are lying on the floor. They seem to be tired, one of the men has… Seems to be in pain.
And the, the…I cannot see this, the face of the third person, but another man is lying next to him, resting, so probably he is asleep or very tired as well. And the fourth man is lying towards all of them.
