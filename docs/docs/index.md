## About

Netts is package for analysing the content of natural speech.
Mapping semantic content of speech as a network and analysing the network using graph theory is a powerful approach for deep phenotyping in psychiatry.
Netts is a novel speech algorithm that captures the semantic content of transcribed speech in **semantic speech networks**.

Netts uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to construct speech networks from transcripts of spoken text (e.g. <em>I see a man</em>).
Nodes represent entities (e.g. <em>I</em>, <em>man</em>) and edges represent relations between nodes (e.g. <em>see</em>).

The tool is freely available as a python package and accessible online.
The tool can be installed from PyPI \ref{PyPi} and used to construct a semantic speech network from a text file with a single command.
You can find installation instructions under "Getting Started" and a user guide under "Usage". Figure \ref{FigurePipeline} gives an overview of the main processing steps a text file goes through. For a detailed explanation of the processing pipeline, see "Pipeline".
